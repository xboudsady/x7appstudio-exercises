# Adding 2 numbers together
The following code uses the ``prompt()`` function to get two numbers from the user. It then adds those two numbers and writes the result to the page:

However, if you try out the code, you’ll discover that it doesn’t work. Why not?

Change the code so that it does work.

```js
var firstNumber = prompt("Enter the first number", "");
var secondNumber = prompt("Enter the second number", "");
var theTotal = firstNumber + secondNumber;

document.write(firstNumber + " added to " + secondNumber + " equals " + theTotal);
```
